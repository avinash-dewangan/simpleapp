# Scheduler
To implement a scheduler in Spring Boot with Java 17, you can use Spring's @Scheduled annotation to define scheduled tasks. Spring Boot's scheduling is based on Java's ScheduledExecutorService and offers an easy way to run tasks at fixed intervals, at specific times, or using cron expressions.

Steps to Implement a Scheduler in Spring Boot:
Enable Scheduling: Use @EnableScheduling in your Spring Boot application to enable the scheduling mechanism.
Create Scheduled Tasks: Use the @Scheduled annotation on methods that you want to run periodically.
Example: Simple Scheduler in Spring Boot
1. Enable Scheduling in the Application Class
   First, you need to enable scheduling in the main Spring Boot application class using the @EnableScheduling annotation.
2. Define Scheduled Tasks
   You can create a new component or service that will contain the scheduled methods. Use the @Scheduled annotation to define tasks that run at a fixed rate, fixed delay, or using a cron expression.

## Explanation of Scheduling Parameters:
* @Scheduled(fixedRate = X): Runs the method at a fixed rate, where X is the interval between invocations (in milliseconds). The next execution starts without waiting for the previous task to complete.
>Example: @Scheduled(fixedRate = 10000) runs every 10 seconds.
* @Scheduled(fixedDelay = X): Runs the method after a fixed delay, where X is the time (in milliseconds) between the completion of the last execution and the start of the next.
>Example: @Scheduled(fixedDelay = 5000) waits 5 seconds after a task finishes before starting the next one.
* @Scheduled(cron = "cronExpression"): Executes the method based on a cron expression. Cron expressions allow precise control over scheduling.
>Example: @Scheduled(cron = "0 * * * * *") runs the method every minute, at the 0th second.

## Cron Expression Syntax:
Cron expressions follow the pattern:
sql

>second minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week

>For example, the cron "0 0 9 * * *" will run the task every day at 9:00 AM.


## Example Use Cases:
> Fixed-Rate Execution: Use this when you need a task to run at regular intervals regardless of its execution time.

>Fixed-Delay Execution: Use this when you want to start the next execution only after the previous one has completed.

>Cron-Based Execution: Use this when you need precise control over the execution schedule (e.g., run a task every Monday at 8 AM).

## Testing the Scheduler:
> When you run the Spring Boot application, the scheduled tasks will execute based on their respective configurations.

> In the console output, you will see the tasks running at the configured times, which helps confirm the scheduler is functioning as expected.
